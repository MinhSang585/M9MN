Blackjack wasn't popular in the United States at first, so casinos tried to offer a variety of extra bonuses to attract players to the game. One of the additional bonuses is that when the player has both the ace of spades and the jack of black (either the jack of spades or the jack of clubs), the bonus will be multiplied by 10. Such cards were called 'Black Jack,' and the name came to be known as the game of blackjack, and the name 'Black Jack' continued even after this bonus rule was discontinued.
